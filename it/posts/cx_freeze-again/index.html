<p>It's been a long time since the last post and for sure I was not thiking about
another post about cx_Freeze.
I have spent this week end trying (and at the end  succeding) to build an
update to an old software. For future memory I'll write briefly the steps needed
to get a functional build without losing my mind.</p>
<div class="section" id="biref-description-of-the-problem">
<h2>Biref description of the problem</h2>
<p>The software is a desktop application used to upload email attachments to a
web based data store; the application talk to the web app using a "RESTy" api,
and fetches the file from a email address; the GUI is written with the beatiful
PyQT5 (someone may prefere PySide) and usually this dependency is a pain to
work with but I have to admit that the newer version installs gracefuly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="os-version-and-things-to-download">
<h2>OS version and things to download</h2>
<p>The person using this software needs to run it from a Windows OS and at this time
Windows 7 is the oldes worsion of the OS I want to support (no Vista, please)
since addressing Windows 10 will produce an executable with no retro compatibily
and Windows 8 have less installs than 7.</p>
<p>The first software needed to be dowloaded is obviusly the Python 3.5 interpreter
and after its installation came the first surprise, it doesn't run because of
some missing dlls; after some research I have downloaded the redistribuitable
runtime and it started to work as expected.</p>
<p>After Python was ready I've had to install the pip utility which was not
automatically installed, maybe I have forgotten to chek the corresponding
option in the installer; anyway everything installed correctly using it, this is
a brief list of dependencies:
- requests: OK
- paramiko: OK
- imapclient: OK
- PyQT: (surprisingly!) OK
- cx_Freeze: Not ok at all..</p>
<p>cx_Freeze requires Widonws build tools that can freely (as in beer) downloaded
and installed but even after that I was not able to install it from pip;
fortunately some kind people provided a procompiled wheel for it but be sure
to download the 5.0 version because the 4.x was not able to produce a proper
executable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="additional-dependencies-and-some-setup-py-notes">
<h2>Additional dependencies and some setup.py notes</h2>
<p>Having not touched I tought that the setup script was soemwhat correct since
the last build was succesful, nothing more far from the truth; the first thing
has been a nice surprise, cx_Freeze recognized correctly all the dlls to use in
the final package and referencing additional dlls is not needed anymore, good
work cx_Freeze guys!</p>
<p>After the first build ihave started a cycle of try, fix retry until the
application could as expected, here is a list of additional dependencis that I
had to install and reference in the setup.py file:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>appdir</li>
<li>packaging</li>
<li>atexit</li>
</ul>
<p>appdir and atexit only need to be referenced as packages instead packaging
requires some more fine tuining so I had to add this additional sub-packages
to the includes settings of the build_exe_options dictionary:
- packaging.version
- packaging.specifiers
- packaging.requirements</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-words">
<h2>Final words</h2>
<p>It took me a couple of hours of trial/error to be able to ship the build and I
hope to not have to repeat this madness again soon; if I'll need to create a new
build in the future I hope that this little post will halp me not to waste my
time again.</p>
