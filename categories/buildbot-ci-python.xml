development of automation solutions in the field of software development.
Unlike other systems such as Jenkins (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://jenkins-ci.org/"&gt;http://jenkins-ci.org/&lt;/a&gt;) or TravisCI
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;https://travis-ci.org/&lt;/a&gt;) buildbot only provides a framework on which to build
the infrastructure that you need .
The project has client-server architecture where the server sends to the client
the work to be performed, the server is called master and the clients are
called slaves; the framework supports multiple masters and multiple slaves, in
this way the system architecture can easily grow with the needs of your
project.
Buildbot is available for virtually any platform, even if the current version
0.8.x platform support win32-64 is not exactly the best though still usable
with some changes (see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/RunningBuildbotOnWindows"&gt;http://trac.buildbot.net/wiki/RunningBuildbotOnWindows&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Buildbot at sysgrove&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For our development needs in SysGrove( &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sysgrove.com"&gt;http://sysgrove.com&lt;/a&gt;) buildbot is used to
generate the release of our application for the win32 platform. Every 12 hours
we verify that there are some changes in our repository
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/sysgrove/sysgrove"&gt;https://bitbucket.org/sysgrove/sysgrove&lt;/a&gt;) and in this case, the following
operations are performed:
- Download the project from the repository (we use git, but the system supports hg, svn, bazaar etc ...)
- Launch the test suite (in this case we use the testing tool discovery nosetests)
- Generate the executable using py2exe
- Build the initial database (sqlite and postgres)
- It creates the archive with the application executable and test database(s)
- Load the new release on "Confluence"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly doing all these steps manually is tedious and can beprone to errors
or oversights that would decrease the quality of our product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="our-setup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Our setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned at the beginning we (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sysgrove.com/"&gt;http://sysgrove.com/&lt;/a&gt;) need to create an
executable for the platform win32 (and possibly in the future for linux and
osx) for which we need to run our script inside a win32 OS; given the relative
difficulty of configuring a master on windows it was decided to have the master
in a linux host (debian jessie) and a slave in a virtual machine
with windows 7 ™ since that the slaves give far fewer problems .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="configuration"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration file, as with cfg extension, is a simple python script, you
can use this file to configure these main areas:
- Slaves: you can define how many slaves you want each with its own identity
- The scheduler: the scheduler indicate how and when the activities will be planned by the master
- The builder: indicate the steps to take to create a build
- Notifiers: the master can communicate in many ways the status of the build such as irc, email or web
- Various configurations such as the database to use to store the state of the system, the identity of the project (name, url) etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="pitfalls"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pitfalls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier I had some problems with windows, probably due to my
inexperience with the version of python for this operating system.
One of the first difficulty concerns sqlalchemy, an ORM for python; buildbot
requires in fact a version of sqlalchemy == 0.7.10 as our application requires
a newer version.
Typically, such a problem is solved easily using the handy tool
virtualenv (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv"&gt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;) creating an environment
for the master (the part that needs access to a db, sqlite by default) and one
environment for the slave, but given my experience with windows, I could not
separate the environments (which is why the master is on a debian host and
the slave is a on windows VM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the general concepts of buildbot, extend and customize the
functionality becomes simply a work of configuring and creating scripts that do
the real work, besides the web interface by default enables us to keep track of
our builds and forcing new if it were needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is not a "point and click" tool to everyone and this is a good
thing, in my humble opinion and responsibility for the maintenance of such
a system requires knowledge of a typical IT department and not a manager who,
if desired, can always send us an email to request a build rather than messing
around with his hands no expert ;)&lt;/p&gt;
